And two weeks from today we'll get our last program assigned it has something to do with operator overloadingso we'll get that figured out exactly what that is I haven't finalized this timing yet but this is what it's going to be on program 5 is there two weeks to stay on the switch 5 I mean you can just go through here and see the kinds of things we're talking about the last week of class we're going to have a quiz and then the last day of class which is going to be the 8th we'll review the quiz so you'll know why you missed any problems you did prepared for the final testwe'll also talk about anything else we might have ivy come and do another presentationto get us ready for the final test and then the week after 15 that's what our fine test is here for body stuff any questions on the scheduleokay so I wanted to talk aboutstring coffeeand string laneI don't want to disappoint you guysthat's worth the pointCoffee and or strange length now if we createa sea spring it's going to nuisance why do we even have such a thing why don't we just use strange which is a very well mannered well behaved data structure and cloud why do we even talk about C stringboy I didn't do a very good jobbecause it wasn'tyou kind of standardized the C language which the C language was patterned after and still supports doesn't go anything about strings and so in order to use words in the C language we had to store them in a character array now the reason it called C string is because there's a special attribute that the C compiler C++ compiler to the ones expectedthese character raised are expected to see a no at the end of the wordso it's important to have that null available if there's no no in your character array it's not AC string so character rays can hold sea strings or they can hold a raise of characters either one it's kind of a special thing I did a search last night on how many lines of C code exist in the wild and I got billions billionsso likely if you work for a company that has any historical programs which most companies do they probably have some C programs that are going to have to maintain gas and gets to maintain the old stuff the new peopleslikely if you're an intern or brand on the job you're going to be exposed to some old C code that doesn't work quite right it has to be modified so we're just explosive you toarcanedata structurethat C language used to support works back in the day so let's go ahead and have a little example and the test had some interestingexamples on it you know when you declare a variable is this what's in that how long is a string nice blah blah blah let's go ahead and write the string length function now we'll go ahead and includewhere do we get the C string stufffrom the C string libraryplease bringit in however I'm going to comment this outnow I happen to know how I like the asa using namespacethen I'm going to declare a variable that's going to hold AC string so this is going to be a character array i'll call it a and I will give it a sizeand I will initialize that it says character array right now not AC string it's a character array i'm going to initialize it withthe word bingonow what is a is it still a character array only a character raceit now has AC Street in it how many characterswere used to get bingo into the character array called 8okay name them BINGO Nowe have to remember that no travels with the word so if we didn't have any parameters here if we had closed brackets we would have got 123456 the know would have been there and the size of this the size of would be sixwhich is different than having BINGOS single characters so that's a conceptual thing we need to just remember if we're going to be using C strings we have to remember there should be a null at the end now 10 is big enough to hold six characters and so there's no issue with that let's go ahead and see how to writethe string length function so I'm going to say see outSTRLEN and I will fast pay there what should be printedon thisohh what should you print it outstring length of A what do you say 1010 is size up that's how many bites that very low the array has this is not what we're looking for stream length is a function found in the C string library I have not included in a comment that out so let's go ahead and try to run this program and see what it gives us I expect it's going to say I'm going to think about string lengthand it does it says I don't know anything about string length use the function I don't understand okay let's come back hereand I'm coming this running againI think it ran what do you think the output is going to be how big is bingo as far as string went first now it's 5 we don't include the low let's see if we actually got a fireand we did 5 okay so I'm going to pretend that there's no such thing as a string library and I'm going to write the function string link so let's go ahead and write thatso sdr lem is what I'm writing so I can support this program it's an integer function and it's named strlen and what I'm passing in what does it look like i'm passing in right therecheck it let's go ahead and make that a character right CHAR let's call it V no racesand two brackets right thereokay does that look right okay now I'm passing the character array into a functionwhat have you always done in the past when you passed an array into a functionyou tell the sidesI'm not going to decide i'm passing the array and it's going to tell me the size basicallyso in order to get that done I need to do what you thinkyou can simply tell meafforded why a forumok so it would suggest that I do a for loop so how many times should I put this for loop how many times should I run this for loopI don't know what you've been through okay so if I do the 4 loop I'm going to kill something happensthen there's the 4 loop the best choiceit needs to be looking for the null well maybe a while it is better nowI'm somewhat skilled in the C language I could use a forum it would look weird because it wouldn't have the rightincremental I would have nothing for the incremental instead of test would be until something happens OK soit's great if you're going to do so many times a Waterloo is great if you don't know ahead of time how many times you're going to do it either will work one might be a better choice if you're trying to impress your team leader or boss because I guarantee it first year of the job you're going to be hovered over and you're going to say why did you choose this approachand if you can think back to this class and say what did gold say about that well I don't think he knew what he was talking about so what did Terrell say about that terrell is pretty smart so well because I learned this in collegeso if you choose a particular approach understand why you chose that it's going to help you understand it better also so let's do a while loop here now while whata is the array index I'm going to say index 5 which means I should probablydo an integer I equals zero because I know that if I haven't randomly started the zooth index so while a into J or index I isnot equal tono now we have a no character that is \ zero so while it's not equal to noand I don't need that; it's not going to occur if it's not going to help then what should I doincrement okay so I've incremented all right what will it when I finally knowit'll be the number of charactersI crossed in order to find in the north which incidentally should be the string length and so if I just returnbythen that should work yeah for the dialog it should bethatthat's it okay why do you think I didn't use asomeone's going to point out because that's the main thing it wasn't the main my next question to myself you guys are not beginning programmers anymore so you understand scope so to myself I would say is there a difference between this A and that a yeah they're not even related they have the same name but they're totally different scope totally different memory addressesor are theywell okay let's see we have two temporary rays rightOK let's go ahead and run this and just see why I'm him high here in just a minuteOK so it didn't it didn't break it recognized there was a string length function that I created and it gave me 5 is that what I accepted I think so so let's see I have another question for youI'm passing an array right you know what I don't like arrange they were mean to me when I was growing up so I'm going tonot use a rate because I like pointersI do thatand receiving a point where I passed an array in name I received a pointer in string lengthand then I got lazy or my wife called me to dinner so I did even bother changing the rest of the program I just changed star aseem to compilesame exact output now what have I been saying from the moment we started talking about arrays and pointerthey're the same thing if you passed an array to function what does the Fox receiveit receives a pointer to where that array starts and I can write something like this and chill that front manager and say look I'm using the raising pointersindiscriminately as if they're the same thingand then when he fires you at the other day because you're too confusing you can go to a startup company who likes to confuse arrays and pointers but let's go ahead and look at this and change the whole program to support pointers instead of arrays so obviously if I pass in a pointer I can index it as if it's an array because C doesn't really recognize the difference between pointers and arraysit's the same thing so let's fix this upwhat should I do here make thispointer notation instead of a rate notationplus Iokay what's that going to give melet's see if we understand this what's the plus I going to give me when I add an integer to a pointerkinect kind ofit will be a pointer to the next itemso what will that print out as I print that outorokay points to the first index second index whateverif I printed out a plus I what I'm going to see on the screenI'm going to see an address we've seen address and so if I increment a pointer by adding something to it I need to dereference it to have it make senseso I will dereferenced it by putting the * in front and so now this is sayingthe pain pointed to by that's how I look at that star and interpret that the thing pointed to by a plus I this is not equal to zero so now I'm going to get to B the I the end of I'm going to get the contents of the array instead of locations and memory where the erase that's or part of the erase is so all I did was change that let's go ahead and run this and what I write to do is I like to make one small change run it and see if I understand what's going on what do you think the output is going to beshould we find again and it still is so I'm doing okaywe coulddo thatwhat am I doing nowI'm incrementing the pointer so what does that do it gives me the next location where a character should liveso this will be interesting I hope this will do the same resultand I still get five and make it continue to make this a little bit more complicated I like the idea of taking something very simple like this strange length function and showing that a raised character and pointers are the same once you get them into a function that's part of the strength of C and C because you can identify the exact location of a memorylocation for a variable or a part of it that means you can get to their place quickly do what you want to do and get out quickly I thought it doesn't allow this doesn't support it maybe that's one of the reasons why C++ is **** it's also one of the reasons that C++ is considered harder because you can do things you're not supposed to because you can so sometimes you want to try so that's what I wanted to show you about this string length function we can actually create functionsthat look exactly like system functionsand then comment out the library inclusion and use them so we're going to study maps Thursday we can create a map class instead of the one that supplied by C++ ledger we can create I don't know a vector class instead of the one that's supplied by the C++ library and these are fun activities that teach us more about the inner workings of some of thesedata structures that we just take from that questionsOK that seemed like the longest nation that I kind of liked it I have a video to share with youlet's go to Youtube I can search from there betterIIThings start well the rocket clears the tower and accelerates smoothly and then the rocket abruptly changes direction starts to break apart and suddenly explodes less than a minute after launch huge chunks and glowing fragments of Ariane flight 5O1 rain down over the launch area a shocking disaster for Ariane and the ESA the cause a simple utterly avoidable coding bug OK here's what happenedthe Arianne 5 leaves the launchpad and accelerates smoothly into the sky following its predetermined path towards space inside the onboard guidance system is constantly tracking the Rockets trajectory and sending the data over to the main flight computer to do so the guidance system converts the velocity readings from 64 bit floating point to 16 bit integer okay stop for a second and let's think about what that actually means computers store numbers in a variety of ways consider 4 bit integersfour bits can represent anything from zero to 15 but if you want to represent the number 16 well there just aren't enough bits are they 16 is too big you need more bits to store bigger integers with 16 bits you can store anything from zero to 65,535 or if you throw in a sign then 16 bit signed integers cover everything from minus 32,768 to positive 32,767but anything bigger than that and again you've run out of bits floating point numbers are stored a bit differently they're stored as a decimal or significant and an exponent the details aren't really important here all you need to know is that 64 bit floating point can store much larger numbers than can fit into a 16 bit integer so converting between them can be tricky when the integer runs out of bits so what does happen when you run out of bits well if you're using 16 bits signed integers the conversion will just wrap around to the beginning again but whatever the details you're definitely getting the wrong answer this is known as an integer overflowright so back to our rocket the guidance system reads the horizontal velocity data of the rocket as 64 bit floating point and tries to convert that into a 16 bit integer to send over to the main flight computer but at moment the velocity reading is actually larger than the largest possible 16 bit integer the system tries to do the conversion and fails now a clever system would have some procedure built in that says hang on we're piloting a rocket here I need to say something sensible to the main computer it would have some overflow error handling codebut in this case guidance system code isn't very clever so it just sends an error message in place of the velocity data and promptly shuts down fortunately there's a backup guidance system in case the primary module breaks down unfortunately it's running the same code so it does the same conversion gets the same overflow and crashes for the same reason the main computer receives the error message and because there's no handling code built in the computer interprets the message as real navigational dataand immediately freaks out the velocity reading is of the charts indicating that the rocket is dangerously impossibly of course so the flight computer does what it's designed to do it fires up the boosters and drags the rocket around in an attempt to rescue itself from a non existent disaster this puts the fuselage under incredible aerodynamic strain which starts tearing the rocket apart detecting the things and how real going badlythe computer calls it a day and triggers the built-in self-destruct mechanismso what was the ultimate cause of this incredibly expensive very short and ultimately catastrophic rocket flight a simple line of code converting a floating point to an integer that led to an overflow passed without warning to the main computer which was interpreted as real if wildly inaccurate datathe flight software had been used previously with no problems on many flights of the smaller Ariane 4 rockets but the Ariane 5 was designed to fly faster than any one planned for when the software was originally written the high velocity led to the overflow error the floor that should have been found it just never came up want to know the worst case that buggy bit of code wasn't even necessary during flight it was part of the launch pad alignment process and shouldn't have been running after liftoffbut sometimes a small glitch somewhere causes a launch to be delayed by a few seconds so to save having to reset the system the original programmers decided to keep that bit of code running for 40 seconds after the scheduled liftoff timethat means you're trying to figure out how it's ridiculous errors occurredso how can this administratordo it again to me they could have passed them to software on the new runand if you do a simulation and if you do a deep dive into this particular problem which I can hide them about it's been an hour or two tracy downthe exact cause and I forgot I think it was important programs they ran regardlessthe test software the the flight control software worked fine on their own core so why did we have to change it for the area on 5 I think it was that bad deal that's about $2 billion for those satellites percent up there 1996it's probably a little bit more most of your time I certainly was working as professional at this time so overflowcan you get overflows in pythonyou know you really can't because they designed their numbers so that they won't experience overflow which makes sense I mean if you're starting to count I think Mr Beast counted to a million over four or five days something that was one of his first youtube videos maybe it wasn't that much but he can't and that's all I did worked out for him he goes pretty good now he has some really weird videos you started in fact there shouldn't be an overflow problem you should be able to count forever c plus plusdecided that we're going to have fixed size internships largest beam i've said this before what's the largest dentureit's about 2.1 billion and the smallest is about minus 2.1 billion so with that in mind that there exists something called overflow and it can happen and C is a prime candidate for it to happen let's take a breather and see what the current program is going to look like so I'll open this up and now I'm called Gold Rabbits and I have gold rabbitsso I did a little bit next year a little bit extraso almost used to come out there's a bunch of rabbits coming around here in Easter so maybe it's the thing hereokay so let's see what this program's all aboutnow this is partially true stuffI'm talking aboutlet's see hereI will have a birthday before the semester's out the reason I tell you that is because right here in the first sentence because I got a pair of bravets for my birthday that's kind of the feeling for the case so we'll go to that i'm going to get a paragraph to my birthday I did some research and I felt that apparently rabbits multiply like rabbits00 so I'm going to get a rabbit rash and they're going to help me be tired now this has specifically that I'm going to retire in 10 years i'm probably going to retire before then oh you finished in the seated school I think it was less Mr the one I lost isn'tlandit is three and so when I retire and get all the money from the rattle farm she'll still have like seven years to collect the money so this is a real problem you got to figure out how much land we need for a route farm here are the rules for these rabbits I found on the Internet so it's got to be true newborn rabbits take one month to matureone pair of mature rabbits will have a pair of baby rabbits after one monthmature rabbits will continue for today as produce a new pair of baby rabbits every monthrabbits never dieso my question is how many rabbits am I going to have after 10 years how many months is that20 bucks A120months how many rabbits do I have after 120 monthsand I didn't calculations and I came up with this at the start of month zero I have one pair of rabbits that's the baby pairat the start of month one the baby pair has grown upand instantly became president but I still have one pair so at 10 I have one pair at month one I have one pair now that month two the first pair gives burns to the baby pair so now I have the adult pair and a bacon pair so how many do I have now i've got two pairs of bracketsat the third monththe first pair that I had originally gave birth to 2nd set of rabbit and the 2nd pair that were the when the children of the first pair have grown up and instantly become pregnant as do the original pair so how many pairs do I have now I got 3 now it's the 4th month i've got the original which gave birth again to a new pair i've got the first children badge that gave birth to a new pairand then the other ones grew up and so I have a bay pair and I think I have too many pairs and three grown up pairs how many do I have now I should have 5 right I should have 5 or 4I got two and three I should have five and the next month the same thing happens 1000 if you follow this along and if I had a graph I could show better but it follows the same sequence as some famous psychiatrist that led to the 1200 whose name is Viva Natchez so this follows the same sequence as the Fibonacci sequenceinterestingly enough we shall find out in program 6 that Eve pattern has Fibonacci series off of capitalism that's how he wrote it in the book that he publishedso okay i'll give some credit to Fibonacci but he lived in years ago we're talking about now so I'm going to call thisprocess the mgrfcc rpg master goals really cool for me with the rapid roof around the population growth or go brass it's easier to say go brother so your solution or your task is to help me with this problem and we've got to overdone some issues so let me go to continuedo you guys know who created Linuxlinus Portfolio from like Denmarkthere's no who created get up20 years ago singleI found that out last nighthe gives me stuff up really and he's like the smartest guy well yeah I must have done that smart stuff so maybe the smartest guy in the world I don't knowlet's go back to the proof file I have a program written calledGold Braddock now I probably should have got a little bit more but I've detailed here before it's doing this program once it's back herehere's the gold rabbit functionso if I'm asking for an integer N if it's zero or one I'm going to return one otherwise I return gold grab a sand minus 1 plus gold grapes and minus 2 you should recognizethat as the Fibonacci marks nowat that program written herethatprints outsome interesting stuff i'm going to run it for you now that I've introduced that to tell you what it is and it's going to show me how long it takes to calculate the gold grabbage function for the fibonacci function and I call this goldrabbit and you can see it takes less than a second to get all the way up to Bill Grabber screw to settle a minute so the longer 38 30 9:00 40 I'm now at Gold Rabbit 43 look at the number that is seven hundred million one point one billion that's 44taken a long time to get there if I'm only at Gold Rabbit 45how long does it take you to go grab a sponge 20but I got them on rabbits that's really cool rightso warming doesn't want you now it's like oh taking them upbrandon just like the stock market i've reached yesterday today I'm broke what happenedhow long is it gonna take to get to Seminole she won't comecouple weeksmom I don't know this is another slow computer it's got multiple cpusbut I'm not bad i'm back I recovered I don't have as much as I did before but I got a little bit what's going onwhat's that why did it go near you overflowwhy did she first post tell me it says get as part of C motorcycle it just went into overall and said now I'm not just wrap around just like the example on theRockets just wraps around it's got this much memory you work with and once these are all full it drops around starts over again just like odometer on your car wraps around I got three miles on my car new car right you know it's built in 1423 and it's rolled over 17 timesagain this is a problem now one thing I really want to know what gold drivers of 120 yearsbut I will never figure that out because it's taken over a minute here this next one's going to takealmost a minute or more if we look at this go 6 to 99 to 15 so it looks like it's about 24 to 38 maybe half a gain as much and so I should expect this to be92 seconds the next one to be over two minutesso it's growingand making a lot of time to get thereso here's the problem I haveand I want you to help meI want you to write a program that looks like thislet's be 45 how long should it take to get the the gold rabbits of 45 here it was right here it took 15 seconds to get there how long do you think it should take if I just do it immediately oh there we go it's done i'm using the same recursive formula now if we think about this I don't have a good chalkboard system and I'm not sure I can do this i'm oh you know what I dohave a good issueall right send it out or I didaccess to you guysand I have something here on these moduleI'll just pull this up right now I wish it had multiple screenings I could just jump back in for it I don't so I'd have to kind of scroll down so here's the handouts we have for all you know whatI don't have any photos from this you want me to print that one outand we're going to do thatand we'll donot that and I apologize I thought I was readynot ready for prospectingso I will go to yesterday's class we will pull up the information you'll have this before the end of the nightthen we'll retrievethat one here soso this is the next callie draw documentwe will pull it inand I'll be next calendar function here we go here we go I have seen yesterday this is the Fibonacci functionrecursive same thing I showed you about the gold rabbit's function in any signit's interesting because every time I call this function it calls itself not once but twice so when this one gets called it's going to call itself twice again when this midfield is going to call us up twice again so I call it once and then it calls itself twice and then it calls itself four times and then it calls itself 8 times every time I call it it calls itself twice againwhat do you think the big O for this isn times in actually but we found out from our quiz is N ^2 so this is the same growth rate as bubble sortI just showed you a program where I calculated instantly the numberI must have cheated somehow but I used the same exact structure as sending that function now before I give you the answer to how I'm so blazing the class let's think about what happens fibonacci 10 gets passed in here to 10 what happens as soon as this function gets entered and I've shown you over hereit goes and grabs that Fibonacci function from the test library text library and grows on staff and now it's looking on the 10th the Fibonacci for these parameters it immediately comes down and calls seminar N - 1 which goes out and grabs a copy of thefunction and throws them stack of anachi 9 so 10 is paused while nine is being worked on nine comes in and immediately calls N - 1 which is 8 so it drove that on the stack and then 7 and then 6 and then 5 all the way down to Fibonacci 1 fibonacci won return to 1 and so it adds that to the results of the previous one it starts unwinding this back it starts popping things off the stackuntil it gets all the way down to an empty stack and we've calculated what Fibonacci and last one isnow we go to Fibonacci and minus two so immediately throw Fibonacci8 understandsand it doesn't know what that is because we have to go in and call Sibonacci and now we call Fibonaccisettlement I guess because we weren't 8th and ours made money from 7 and so we've been this 8765 but wait a minutedidn't we already bring travel to the nutshell 8 monthswhy does we keep it inwe should have kept it around but we didn'twhen I got popped up and stacked all those vocal variables that cliff did we end that footing stuff I missed that papa said I understand that on this stuff if we were to calculate Fibonacci she's 32we have a tree structure basically on the stack that looks something like thisthe Fibonacci 10 has to calculate Fibonacci 9 and 8 in order to figure out what that is but good notch nine switch to calculate Fibonacci 8 we already calculated 80 well and fifth 7 but before we can do that good enough eight has to calculate fibonacci 7we already did thatbut we didn't keep it around we threw it away we're going to do something called memoization we're going to learn how to use a map and we're going to insert a map inside our fibonacci function so when we calculate the value of Fibonacci 10 we'll put in the map and next time we want to see what it is we'll just go to the map which is like a dictionary in python and we'll immediately give so instead of putting all this stuff on the stackwe'll immediately get the answer so instead of calling the Fibonacci function now this is interesting this is a binary tree it's not quite a full complete tree if it works every level would be completely occupied you turn that in probably 277 that's classes probably 274 data structure and algorithmsokay we're talking about Fibonacci 32 how many times will I have called Fibonacci's function if I pass in a 32 and don't optimizebut that'sabout 2 billionbecause an integer is 32 bits wide and 32 and 2 to the 31st is about 2.1 build which I say is the largest cost of that number so two to the 32 to the 32nd power is about 4.2 billion now I made a call with Fibonacci function 4.2 billion times putting stuff on the stack up in the mouth putting them on top of the mouth putting them on top of the mouth taking secondsor I can create this map structure so I remember what the value of a particular criminality sequence is and if I don't have it in the map i'll quickly figure out where it should be stick it in there now my program runs instantaneously so we're going to learn how to do that and decide that that's part of the assignment but I wanted to show you this cool freeze and I even did itI think that's cool that took a little bit of effort sookay okay look at the second we're almost done we're almost done herealmost there yes we're on theline apparently has this document so you guys don't start out there you will get it to do that out butyou see here so there we go let's go back to the startup we're almost done we'll wrap it up here show you a demo of what's expected and we're going to get out early todayhey so let's see how far we got you know that we got the rules for the gold rabbits we know that we've got this function that is the exact same thing as Fibonacci so if I say gold rabbits it's Fibonacciand this is the recursive versionnow is this the only way we can writeanother wordOKA wireless we could do a loop that's caused iterative no recursion involved we can go and calculate it it's a little bit more complicated but it's fast it's fashionable it doesn't have to be recursion it doesn't have these factors there's everything in one column or function that's a possibilitythis is probably my favorite function just because we can learn so much just by analyzing a couple of lines of code and we learned about this really powerfulmechanical thing called recursion and once you understand recursion things just open up for you so we can do iteratively we can do it recursively I think there's another way we stillif something called tail concurrent that we'll learn more about in programs of six we're not gonna do tailors here we did tailored curves and it's also almost instantly fast it doesn't use as many resources still doesn't cursion but it doesn't pay and it's more very efficient more complicated to understand more complicated to build folks so this is the bumps and we're going to use double recursionwe as a group have to figure out how to insert a mapping herein such a way that it can rememberwhen the calculated the previous version is the okaywe also I gave you this program this is the one that I was surprised at when it went negative I lost all my stuff in the stock market this is the exact program you can use this as a starting point and you'll see how things are working maybe you want to put stuff in here a printout statement cannot hurt something keep track of things and just show it on the screen so you can have a better idea of what's going on when this program runsand this is the gold grabbage function so called the gold grabbish herewe know that it overflowed this is the output of that program that I showed youand he didn't say that why we went negative so this is the assignment that you guysdorewrite the gold rabbits functionso thatit grows an exception if it detects integer overflow if you saw integer overflow I recommend detecting control of course the largest entry2.1 billion you take a large integer we add one to it what do we getsome negative numberswhich indicates the older part we take the largest integer and we add the largest integer to it what we getis done today a good number it indicates overflow therefore we can deduce that if we add two non negative messages togetherthe range being from one to the max integer we are going to get a negative integer result so we can deduce if we add 2 integers together and get a negative we overflow that's the thing that we can do the C doesn't bother to help us with it you have to detect an overflow and instead of returning a bogus number that's overflowed we will throw an exception saying overflow occurred at N =7046 every single program that you submit that's correct will say 46 but don't just throw out 46 if we ran your program on a cray computer or some other computer that has a bigger max than 2.1 billion or we converted to python we're not gonna get an overflow so don't throw that 46 go back to the number that caused the overflowbut make sure you calculate it because my graders will look at it around it didn't calculate OK so we have to take the overflow throw an exception you'll catch that exception somewhere that stuff for your design but you know how to throw and catch steps and so there's no new knowledge herespeed up the gold rabbit's function so that it's fastyou can use a stag maps static now when I was talking about a map to throw in the function you guys draw this knot in your head yeah that's something that I did well when that function gets popped off the statgo to the mouse howdy's going to make it so that the other function you can call is that same map it's a ecstatic make it global we'll do the same result with the children's point because you have to use a static OKI don't think we've used static yet in class we've used global for the last program but we haven't used the static map 3 double values are stored in the map in the gold routed sponsors based on number twoif the incoming parameter is minus onethen the function will print out the contents of the map i'll show you what that looks like but minus 1 is the key trigger to be something special won't calculate the gold rabbits at minus 1 instead you'll detect that and print out the contents of the mapand it talks about first and second we'll understand that better when we study maps next to the time we meet and I have a sample belowthere's alsosomethingthat's the program that the parameters are string the program will print an error you can't do a fibonacci on a string OK and then it's been about a negative number besides negative one so you're not required to test if it's negative or notcan't you want so I decided to do partners so here's an example of how you'll run the program now you are expected to submit a log file you know how to do that based on programs 3 and 4 so I'm not going to write the shell script for you but this is the function call that you should write and turn in as your log file so you probably have to do dot slash gold rabbits the way you're in a particular configuration setupsometimes it's in a 4 to minus 1 what should I see when I print i'm passing a 4 what should print out is the output5 maybe OK and then it'll do a minus 1 what is expected to see nowthe map and so the key value the key in the value and I'll show that here in a minute 6I think that's eight maybe and minus 1 so now the values from zero to six3 3 I think and minus one well you've got the map all the way up to six and so he sits together monkeyerror9000there's 9000 of valves the integer it is I just turned out when he passed in 9000overflowat 46 but you'll calculate that you want to say that horse air 45one point eight billion forty seven overflow atsome of this is the function the program that you write this is the command line parametersI don't want anything going to be but if you're interested in integer you talk about the Nachi or build rabbits sequence number - 1 pronounce the math as it exists strangeerror so you've got to have some try catch stuff so you can continue to process it's not a one-shot deal this is continuing process this is what the primary actually look like that's in the floor it was 5 that's in the minus 1 you map out the the contest you've got the contentsyou've got six these are the 13 - 1got three into 3 - 1 context let's write the contents even though you're at the three you have up to six in the map and then Bunkie has got a test to charge that the error message you print out still going on 1000 overflowat 46 which is this number so that's over four palette sports is not an instant I have a forty five one point eight built in 15 overflow goodbye 46 that minus 1 32 whateverthere's not a lot of code in this programbut it's very specific because it's arrived i'm giving you very high instructions allowing you to come up with the details i'm giving you a specific set of inputand a specific output so you log files should match my log file exactOK and you just need to submit his gold rabbit dot CTC file and of course the gold rabbit shut the log file notice at the bottomi've got a time saster you have enough information if you look back and programs three and 4 SH files you have to do something with the time command you have to do something with the command typing in there's got to be some arrows go to the gold rabbit stuff logs and you may run across some minor details that's going to be dropped i'll be more than happy to help you fix enough I don't have them in the program to get anythingso can I tell you that you can help me I don't think whyso12 minutesbefore that was something
