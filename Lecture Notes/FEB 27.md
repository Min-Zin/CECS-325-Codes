### **File Analysis & Word Count**
- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Understanding file structure and analyzing its content.
  - Using the `wc` command (word count) to determine file statistics:
    - Number of lines.
    - Number of words.
    - Number of characters.
  - Explanation of newline characters (`\n`) and their role in file parsing.
  - Bytes and characters are essentially the same in size in text-based files.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - A file with **50,000 lines** means it has **50,000 newline characters**.
  - Spaces, tabs, and newlines count as delimiters for words.
  - File content can be read as **numbers** or **text strings**.
  - When a file is read, depending on the interpretation, numbers may be processed as:
    - **Integers**
    - **Text Strings**
  - Binary storage is required for storing real numbers efficiently.

### **Sorting Algorithm & Performance Measurement**
- **Sorting File Data**
  - File generation and sorting were tested.
  - `generate` command creates a file with numbers.
  - **Bubble Sort** was used for sorting.
  - Performance measurement was done with **time** command.
  - `sortbatch.log` used to log execution times.

- **Time Complexity Analysis**
  - Measured time for sorting **10,000**, **50,000**, etc.
  - Growth rate follows **O(nÂ²)**.
  - Time is affected by CPU usage and background processes.

- **Shell Scripting & Automation**
  - A shell script (`sortbatch.sh`) was used for batch sorting.
  - Redirection of standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) to log files.
  - Explanation of:
    - **Standard input (0)**
    - **Standard output (1)**
    - **Standard error (2)**
  - `tail -f` used to monitor log file updates in real-time.

### **Pointers, Memory, and Swap Function**
- **Understanding Pointers**
  - Memory addresses and pointer arithmetic were covered.
  - `*` (dereferencing operator) and `&` (address-of operator).
  - Declaring and assigning pointers:
    ```cpp
    int *ptr;   // Pointer declaration
    ptr = &x;   // Assigning address of variable x
    ```
  - `sizeof(pointer)` discussion: usually 8 bytes (depends on system architecture).

- **Swap Function & Parameter Passing**
  - **Pass-by-Value vs Pass-by-Reference**
    - Regular function call copies values.
    - Using references allows direct memory manipulation.
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    void swap(int &a, int &b) {
        int temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    }
    ```
  - Reference variables (`&`) act as **aliases**.

- **Scope & Lifetime of Variables**
  - Variables declared inside a function are **local**.
  - Reference variables do not have their own memory space.
  - **Global scope vs Local scope**:
    - Global variables persist beyond function execution.
    - Local variables exist only within the function scope.

### **Efficiency Considerations**
- **Bubble Sort Performance**
  - Inefficient for large data sets.
  - Execution time increases quadratically with input size.
  - Consider alternatives like **Merge Sort** or **Quick Sort**.

- **Logging and Monitoring Execution**
  - Importance of using logs for tracking sorting performance.
  - Avoiding unnecessary file overwrites.
  - Background execution with `&` to allow parallel processing.

### **Key Commands & Utilities Used**
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `wc filename` | Count lines, words, and characters in a file |
| `generate` | Create a file with random numbers |
| `time` | Measure execution time of a command |
| `tail -f filename` | Monitor file changes in real-time |
| `sortbatch.sh` | Shell script for batch sorting |
| `&` | Run command in the background |
| `>` | Redirect output to a file (overwrite) |
| `>>` | Append output to a file |
